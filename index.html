    <h2><em>A Guide to Public Transport in London</em></h2>
    <p>London is a city with an absolutely fantastic public transport network, but the <strong>plethora</strong> of choice can be a bit overwhelming for the first time visitor. This information on getting around London comes from <em>my experience</em> living in London for my entire life.</p>


  <br><p>One of the first ways to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B is: <br>
    <ul>
      <li id="lower">by looking on the TFL website, where you will find a map with several coloured lines crossing over one another, indicating the routes of different tube lines, of which there are many.</li>
        <li id="lowest">by using the TFL app</li>

        <br></ul>  <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf">Learn how to plan your journeys</a>
